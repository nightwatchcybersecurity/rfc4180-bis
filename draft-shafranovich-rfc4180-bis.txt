1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used as a common way
   to exchange data between disparate systems and applications for many
   years.  Surprisingly, while this format is very popular, it has never
   been formally documented and didn't have a media type registered.
   This was addressed in 2005 via publication of [RFC4180] and the
   concurrent registration of the "text/csv" media type.

   Since the publication of [RFC4180], the CSV format has evolved and
   this specification seeks to reflect these changes as well as update
   the "text/csv" media type registration.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there had been various specifications and implementations for
   the CSV format (for ex.  [CREATIVYST], [EDOCEO] and [ART])), prior to
   publication of [RFC4180] there is no attempt to provide a common
   specification.  Since then, the CSV format has evolved and there had
   also been additional attempts to formally document this format (such
   as the past work of the W3C's [CSVW] group).

   This section documents the format that seems to be followed by most
   implementations (incorporating changes since the publication of
   [RFC4180]):

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF or LF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and SHOULD contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       MAY be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this MIME
       type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line SHOULD contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and SHOULD NOT be ignored.  The last field in the
       record MUST NOT be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, do not use double quotes at all).  If fields are
       not enclosed with double quotes, then double quotes may not
       appear inside the fields.  Whitespace is allowed between the
       double quotes and commas/line breaks, and SHOULD BE ignored.  For
       example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc"CRLF
       "aaa","bbb", "ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CR or CRLF), double quotes, and
       commas MUST be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc"CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field MUST be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

2.1.  Default charset and line break values

   Since the initial publication of [RFC4180], the default charset for
   "text/*" media types has been changed to UTF-8 (as per [RFC6657]).

   Although section 4.1.1. of [RFC2046] defines CRLF to denote line
   breaks, implementers MAY recognize a single LF as a line break.
   However, some implementations may use other values.

2.2.  ABNF Grammar

   The ABNF grammar (as per [RFC5234]) appears as follows:

file = [header [CR]LF] record *([CR]LF record) [ [CR]LF ]

header = name *(COMMA name)

record = field *(COMMA field)

name = field

field = (escaped / non-escaped)

escaped = *(WSP) DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE *(WSP)

non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

COMMA = %x2C

CR = %x0D ;as per section B.1 of [RFC5234]

DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section B.1 of [RFC5234]

LF = %x0A ;as per section B.1 of [RFC5234]

CRLF = CR LF ;as per section B.1 of [RFC5234]

TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  Update to MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   The media type registration of "text/csv" should be updated as per
   specific fields below:

   Encoding considerations:

      CSV MIME entities can consist of binary data as per section 4.8 of
      [RFC6838].  Although section 4.1.1. of [RFC2046] defines CRLF to
      denote line breaks, implementers MAY recognize a single LF as a
      line break.  However, some implementations may use other values.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in
      [RFC4180] and this document.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is directed to update the the MIME type registration for "text/
   csv" as per instructions provided in Section 3 of this document and
   include a reference to this document within the registration.

5.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations as discussed in [RFC4180] still apply.
